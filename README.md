## ‚úçÔ∏è Configuration

### 1. Define Subscription Plans

Add plans to:

```
etc/subscription_plans.xml
```

Example:

```xml
<plan id="monthly_10">
    <label>Monthly - 10% Off</label>
    <frequency>1m</frequency>
    <discount>10</discount>
</plan>
```

### Terms & Conditions Requirement
Each subscription plan must be linked to a valid, active CMS block in order for the Terms & Conditions modal to render correctly on the product page.

The CMS block identifier is passed via the plan configuration (e.g. weekly_10, monthly_15)

If the block is missing, inactive, or incorrectly configured, the modal will fail to load

CMS content is dynamically fetched via AJAX using this identifier

- Recommendation: Create one CMS block per subscription frequency (e.g. subscription_weekly, subscription_monthly) and ensure they are active

### 2. Assign Plans to Products

Use the `subscription_plan_ids` multiselect attribute  
Stored on **configurable parent** for simplicity and reuse

## üë§ Customer Experience

### On PDP:

* For products with multiple plans: customers can choose between "One-time Purchase" and "Subscribe & Save" with a clear radio selector
* For products with a single subscription plan: a streamlined ‚ÄúSubscribe & Save‚Äù option appears as an alternative to Add to Cart
* Clean, standalone form with Terms & Conditions link and CSRF protection
* Add to Cart remains unchanged to preserve familiar UX
* See available plans and frequencies
* Subscribe with discounted pricing

### In Cart:

* Discount is clearly displayed
* Price adjusted dynamically via plugin
* Plan metadata stored on quote item

### In Account:

* ‚ÄúMy Subscriptions‚Äù tab shows active subscriptions
* View Original Order / View Subscription Orders
* Skip Next Order button

---

## ü•™ Developer Notes

* ViewModels used throughout for clean templates
* LESS is modular: `_subscriptions.less`, `_module.less`, etc.
* All custom logic scoped to module ‚Äî no core overrides
* Reorder and payment logic modular via handler classes

---

## üóïÔ∏è Roadmap Ideas

* Subscription pause/resume
* Scheduled recurring orders
* Admin panel to manage active subscriptions
* Email reminders for next order date
* Support for additional payment gateways via handler plugin

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Wishlist Integration Limitation

This module customizes the cart item renderer blocks (`default`, `simple`, and `configurable`) to inject subscription details.  
Due to how Magento processes layout XML and module load order, the `Move to Wishlist` button (injected by `Magento_Wishlist` into `checkout.cart.item.renderers.default.actions`) **may not render correctly**.  
At present, full compatibility with Magento's Wishlist module **is not guaranteed**.  
The cart item actions block exists as expected, but **Wishlist's layout injection may be skipped** if the renderer blocks are not available when it runs.  
We recommend testing the integration thoroughly if Wishlist is a required feature.
